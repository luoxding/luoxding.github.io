      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t already know, camply is an open-source Python project that I created a little while ago that helps people to find and snag last minute cancellations at campgrounds all around the USA.
I got the idea for camply when my partner and I took a road trip last summer. When we started planning campgrounds to stay at inside of National Parks during our trip, we quickly discovered that campsites at busy destinations like Yellowstone and Glacier are a hot commodity and totally booked out.</description>
